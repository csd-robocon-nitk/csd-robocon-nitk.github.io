                <p>
                    CSD Robocon NITK is one of the foremost robotics
                    teams at NITK. Since 2018, we have been participating
                    in the ABU Robocon (Asia Pacific Broadcasting Union
                    Robotics Contest), which is touted as the ultimate
                    robotics challenge for undergraduates.<br/><br/>
                    We build robots that aim for incredible precision,
                    reliability and speed or, in other words, industrial
                    performance. Sadly, the pandemic disrupted the 2022
                    event for us, but we werenâ€™t deterred by it. We strived to
                    simulate the robots on ROS, honing our skills for the
                    next event. This year, we aim to be back with a bang!

                            ABU Robocon. The experience helped us develop
                            the thought processes
                            required for the upcoming years.

                            robot - a quadruped
                            which tackled planes,
                            slopes and steps alike.
